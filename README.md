Project - AutoMate

Objective 

 - Our end to end application has been designed to make the user experience pleasant for searching the right vehicle service provider for userâ€™s car.
 - A user can request to register his/her car with AutoMate which sends the request to Admin to verify all the car details. 
 - Once admin has verified and approved the car registration, the user can now search and choose from all the service providers.
 - All the service providers are managed by the admin so the user does not have to worry about the authenticity of these service providers.
 - Users also get the feature of saving the receipts of the service done on their cars and will also be able to view the service history of the car in a timeline format.
